[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s been about 3 months that I switched from Github over to Gitlab. At my previous job. I had to use github actions for pipeline. Now I use Gitlab. I can honestly say that Github is 100 times better and more intuative on how it works. As well as the market place is a great resource. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if Gitlab has something like that built into their roadmap. However, I keep writing code that I know other people have solved, because I find it in gitlab threads. So why would Gitlab continue to propagate the re-invention of the wheel? Ideally CICD makes you more productive. But if you have to keep writing custom code that other people have solved. Even if it just takes 30 minutes to look up, copy, paste and run, it would still be faster to have a market place with small pieces of code that solve a very specific issue.\nAnother one of my gripes with Gitlab is the fact that you cannot have multiple actions. But rather you must either use templates and pull into a single file, which I understand the concept, but ideally I should be able to seperate files per functionality completly different behavior from one another.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the example of the issue above.\n I want to run X amount of pipeliens at night I want to run X amount of pipelines that are differnt manually.  I must place both of those rules in the same file, instead of having two well defined files that reduce the scope of each pipeline.\nOne project can have multiple pipelines especially in QA depending on the bussiness need. QA Could want to run Smoke or Regression without having to share the file just to make it easier.\nGitlab also forces you to do things by pipeline. However, in a QA world, sometimes you have data generation scripts that you might want to run at any given time that do not fit on a pipeline and you want to outsource that run to less experienced peeps that might not know how to run scripts locally. Github Actions allows you to give them a link and tell them just click run. Vs Gitlab forces you to have a pipeline setup. Makes no sense. I understand the concept of jobs inside pipelines, but not everything is always a pipeline.\nSo if you are looking to go with Github or Gitlab. Choose Github. It\u0026rsquo;s the clear winner from a QA perspective.\n*2023-03-06T19:22:56-06:00\n","permalink":"https://fonzi.xyz/blog/pipelining-qa-in-gitlab/","title":"Pipelining Qa in Gitlab"},{"content":"Sprints. Everyone uses them it seems like. However, there is a reason why there are new ways of developing software. Sprints are waterfalls in essence. Methodologies like Kanban really outshine sprints. In modern software development where you can create infrastructure in IaC and Deploy with tools like AWS / GitHub / Pipeline. These modern tools allow you to deploy faster, which is what every company claims they want to do, but never actually break out of the mold. Now some teams do need sprints, just like some teams do need water fall. But most \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; teams will greatly benefit from Kanban. There is no reason why there should be these massive amounts of code getting released every 2-3 weeks where you can exercise every part of the release multiple times a day.\nYou can see how most of these \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; companies try to be kanban by adding feature flags to undone features, breaking one of the main tenants of sprints. \u0026ldquo;The focus is on delivering a complete and usable product\u0026rdquo;. Why even call yourself sprint and break one of the major tenants. Also take a look at the \u0026ldquo;planning\u0026rdquo; and how bad people are at estimating time. So why keep failing for years instead of just switching. The nice thing about Kanban is that you can still deploy every 2-3 weeks if it helps you feel better, but at least following the basic Kanban flow will help QA and DevOps.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll take it even further saying that with a true CI/CD and Kanban you don\u0026rsquo;t even need a separate pipeline for hot fixes. You\u0026rsquo;d just release the fix as another normal release, one of many during the day. Also look at the sprint meetings. Sprint planning (which every company I\u0026rsquo;ve seen fails at really planning correctly and delivering), sprint reviews which is an artifact of not planning well. Retrospective, which is way too out in the future to recall anything good done. Usually only the bad shows up. Or vise versa in a nice team.\nAt the end of the day Kanban \u0026gt; Sprint. Sprints are the boomers of tech. If you still use sprints and you have the power to change it.

Speeding up every part of the SDLC If you read this blog, then you have heard of ChatGPT. AI for the masses. You know, a lot of people are saying it\u0026rsquo;s the end of software development as we know it, but are they right? I think it\u0026rsquo;s just another tool to help speed up development. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we are at the location where jobs can be fully replaced. Yet\u0026hellip; So how has it increased the SDLC speed. To start doing small simple POC projects has become really easy with this new tool. Not just that, but the context that ChatGPT has is amazing. You can literally use it as a more Junior or Senior Developer, depending on your own personal knowledge.

What is that? A new word is buzzing around. Let me guide you a bit back with buzzwords. The current hot field is DevOps everyone wants to be in DevOps every company needs DevOps. Before that, it used to be two roles. Developer and Operations. Then someone figured out that merging them would be more efficient and a new role was born. Same with TestOps is happening now. Now I think the general tech industry has still not really realized this as a whole. However, more than likely it will be a very big buzz work here soon. At least that\u0026rsquo;s my hope :). Now that Selenium is getting dethroned and frameworks like cypress and playwright are more mature, or even \u0026ldquo;AI\u0026rdquo; supported testing tools like Mabl. There is a new need for a role that can truly support a massive amount of tests. This is where the ops part come in. Things like EvoMaster that are auto-generating API tests, still need someone to maintain that infrastructure. DevOps, could fill and will fill a lot of these roles. Here is TestOps will become a trend. DevOps will realize that they need someone who is versed in dev practices and test practices. What kind of tests to implement, and at which part of the pipeline they should run at. Usually testers (manual and automation) do not really get involved in the pipe lining in the full software cycle. However, most will be forced to learn or get pushed out of the industry. Software has become faster and more fierce. So testers need to adapt. The idea of testing at the end of a cycle (I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you Sprints) is a old way of thinking. Today software teams needs to follow the three main tenants of DevOps.\n Faster flow (push testing to the left) Feedback (fast information must be provided to developers) CI (Things should be happening when integration takes place and the feedback loop needs to keep moving). This third tenant also has experimentation and learning.  Now once you see the new cycle, you can start to see why the role of TestOps will start to appear. Companies will still be interested in having tests ran. And DevOps really still does not take into consideration testing very much. Nor are most DevOps folks in the mentality of finding edge cases. I\u0026rsquo;m not one to think that QA will be pushed out of the industry, it\u0026rsquo;ll still exist, just how it exist for manufacturing. However it will become more automated instead of manual, just like it did in manufacturing. Testers should start adopting the tenants of DevOps and a lot of things will become more clear, and they will become exponentially better at their jobs as well. Testers are a rich mine of knowledge when it comes to workflows, which means that they can share a lot of information with OPS on how clients may use the software which may show a much better infrastructure layout. However, the wind blows. The lines are getting blurred here. TestOps will end up been a part of DevOps and they will mainly focus on the CI side. As soon as tests get kicked off as soon as Pull Request or Merge Request come online. Tests should run. But the big question that QA can fill here, is what tests should run there? Or further down to the right. Why do I think TestOps is the next \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; thing? Because we went from water fall, where the initial cycle was defined. To sprints (the most common one right now) that are mini waterfalls. To now the new kids on the block, Kanban and clean room. So the more efficient these cycles become the more broad these roles will become.\nFri, 16 Dec 2022 16:14:08 -0600\n","permalink":"https://fonzi.xyz/blog/testopts-what-is-that/","title":"TestOps?

Mostly because it\u0026rsquo;s time consuming and it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to have a decent framework. Test are also brittle. However, I peronslly think the brittle-ness is not Automation specific but usually and underlaying issue in the web app. It usually ends up showing up as bad code. Bad implementations, and bad architecture. Since automation is usually created after the webapp, it usually follows those same bad practices as the webapp. Now I\u0026rsquo;m NOT saying that these are the only issues. But from my experience these are usually the true root issues.\nSo how do we solve for this. Usually there seems to be three main problems to solve.\n Bad Architecture Bad Implementation Bad Infrastructure  Bad Architecture Usually this is the first issue. When a webapp has no cohesion around UI and functionality, each page will be it\u0026rsquo;s own small domain. This will make it very hard to abstract tests in order to re-use automation methods. The fix here is to get early into the development cycle and try to drive the model that will be used. However, this is easier said that done. Best approach is to point it out to developers in a nice way. However, good architecs are hard to find, so webapps end up displaying very odd functionality.\nModals with functionality - This is the terrbile espeially with smooth appearing Dropdows with a single button inside - Why is there even a dropdown button for a single button Async calls - This is usually where the bad architecture shows itself and it\u0026rsquo;s hardest to debug. Having all the network calls in async, and not understanding how and why they load in certain orders can cause havoc.\nBad Implementation This is usually done when there is some new cool hip JS library (another reason why I hate JS) and it\u0026rsquo;s the modern thing. Developers use the new library. And it\u0026rsquo;s not implemented correctly. Things are getting forced to the way of the webapp instead of the philosophy of the framework. This is usually and issue with developers not giving back to the Opensource Community. They want to take these establish frameworks. Make them work with some very specific need, and instead of making a PR for the framework to support the case, they\u0026rsquo;ll just hack around it. Usually by mixing another framework or another library making another half-assed implementation.\nBad Infrastructure Now this one is a bit harder to track down, but usually it\u0026rsquo;s obvious once you know what too look for. Usually, bad infrastructure shows as the webapp gets really slow when automation is running. This is usually observable by looking at a Monitoring Tool. Another easy spot is to look at the DB calls that it makes and see if something is locking the db. The final and hardest thing to track down with Infrastructure is the complextity around WAFs. If automation is distributed it might be that the WAF is blocking calls.\nSun, 04 Sep 2022 23:55:43 -0500\n","permalink":"https://fonzi.xyz/blog/ui-automation-root-issues/","title":"UI Automation Root Issues"},{"content":"Node IPC Going Back in Time Well I\u0026rsquo;m sure if you follow this blog (if anyone).

I think this goes back to the first things that I hinted, central technologies are a bad idea.

How many issues do you introduce to a website with WordPress? Even if you look at other frameworks that are found on Github. They all require some other stack that\u0026rsquo;s never on your server. Then you get stuck in limbo trying to get this framework that has 1000 stars because people star it but never actually try it out. So I ended just doing plain HTML with a little script I found in (github)[https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lb]. I still need to modify this a bit, however, it got me off the ground right away. It\u0026rsquo;s gnu compliant so it\u0026rsquo;ll run on any system that has SED and bash. It just inserts blobs of text into files. In my instance, it throws code to blog.html and adds a new file for a standalone blog HTML as well as inserts text to rss.xml. This allows me to just write and not worry about how to run a specific framework, and all the security issues it brings with it. Now I hope that I\u0026rsquo;ll blog more since this is a much easier way to just add files to the blog list. No more manually adding those, no more cryptic commands that only exist in 1 project.

You\u0026rsquo;ll find things like a specific language for just that one blogging platform with no other uses. The worst thing is that it had about 1k stars. What is going on in the modern technology field? Do we no longer like elegant simple solutions? I have an idea to write about this bloated software and how I think modern society has shaped this.\nThu, 07 Oct 2021 02:55:42 +0000\n","permalink":"https://fonzi.xyz/blog/hello-there/","title":"Hello There"}]
