Well well well. As we have all heard. Facebook was down. Like down down. 
You know this is exactly the issue that happens when people allow for centrilized technolgies to get too large.
My family was affected by this since facebook has cornered the market in Mexico. The cell phone plans down there
allow for any cell phone plan to have a limited free internet connection to both Facebook and Whatsapp and a few other smaller own servies. 
This caused havoc down in Mexico like no where else. They are so entrenched in the Facebook ecosystem that millions of people could no longer communicate. 
Of course they could pick up the phone and call, or text each other, however the infrastructure did not scale when needed which caused network congestion. 
So what could be done to solve this? If a whole country is already held to hard by the claws of Facebook, how can they escape it? 

Well, what if people in the US started switching to Telegram or Signal? That may not work since Facebook is willing to pickup the data bill down there. 
A possible solution would be for us to regress in technology. Think about it, is it really needed to be in contact communication with each other? 
Like 24/7? Last time I talked to my close family down in Mexico was about one week ago. See as much innovation and economic growth that the technology has brougt. 
It has also brouth the same ammount of anxiety and stress. Having all the information at your finger tips is nothing short but a miracle. We have the most
amount of knowledge ever. However, at the same time society seems to be getting dumber. You know that you've seen all the little hints. 
Children no longer have the attention span that those children 10 years ago had. People seems to no longer enjoy things with their own senses. 
If you have not noticed, stop looking at your phone next time you go out and look around.
