A simple, minimal personal page. Written in pure HTML and CSS. Used as a way to blog with RSS and keep technology I've encountered and found and used.
Also a personal play site in order to learn more about the basic building blocks of the internet. Everyone likes using high level technology. Not enough
are trying to learn lower level basics.
