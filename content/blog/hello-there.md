# Hello There

If you ended up here either you agreed with something on the homepage. Or you're just clicking around. Either way.. Hello! This blog is dedicated to things I find interesting. Things about technology most of the time, but I also enjoy sociology a lot. So writing about human interactions maybe something from time to time. Also, you will find just recommendations for different things. This will mostly be something for me but I will try to curate those lists. You will also find quick lessons I've learned. 

This blog also follows the minimalist web theme. Where I don't have a blogging platform besides SSH a terminal and my thoughts. So you will just see new entries here without sorting or anything. Perhaps in the future, I'll add something like that along with RSS to keep this going. One of my biggest pet peeves is trying to do a blog site. 

Imagine my shock when I looked through countless GitHub repositories just looking for something that allowed me to just write and would auto-publish, after hours I found nothing that's simple enough. Every technology for this sort of stuff has a very very very complex mechanism for what they do. 

Take a look. You'll find things like a specific language for just that one blogging platform with no other uses. The worst thing is that it had about 1k stars. What is going on in the modern technology field? Do we no longer like elegant simple solutions? I have an idea to write about this bloated software and how I think modern society has shaped this.
