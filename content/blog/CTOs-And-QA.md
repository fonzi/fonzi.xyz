# The Relationship that needs to happen
The relationship between QA and upper management in the software industry is often overlooked, yet it holds significant importance. While QA is typically placed under the umbrella of the engineering department, there is a strong case for QA to have its own VP who can provide dedicated leadership and representation. This separation allows for a more balanced decision-making process that considers both the engineering and QA perspectives.

One common challenge QA professionals face is the misconception that they are less technical compared to developers. However, it is important to challenge this stereotype and showcase the technical expertise within the QA team. By actively demonstrating their skills and knowledge, QA professionals can gain credibility and influence within the organization.

Pushing back on developer decisions can be a delicate process. As QA, we are responsible for finding flaws and ensuring quality, but that doesn't mean we should impose our decisions on the development team. Instead, it is crucial to approach these situations with well-informed solutions and opinions. By presenting our insights in a respectful and collaborative manner, we can foster a culture of open dialogue and mutual understanding.

## How to push forward
To advance in the QA field and establish connections with upper management, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the business and industry landscape. QA professionals should stay updated on industry trends, emerging technologies, and customer expectations. By demonstrating a strong grasp of the business's goals and aligning QA efforts with those objectives, QA professionals can position themselves as valuable assets to the organization.

Crafting a personal brand is another key aspect of building relationships with upper management. Developing a reputation as a skilled and influential QA professional requires consistent effort. Actively participate in industry events, contribute to relevant forums and communities, and share insights through blog posts or speaking engagements. By showcasing your expertise and actively engaging with the larger QA community, you can enhance your professional profile and gain visibility among senior management.

In summary, the relationship between QA and upper management is crucial for effective decision-making and achieving quality goals. By challenging misconceptions, pushing back when necessary, staying informed about the industry, and building a strong personal brand, QA professionals can enhance their influence and contribute to the success of their organizations.
