Starlink. I've been keeping my eye on it since I first heard about it. Finally, in 2024, I had the chance to buy a unit and install it.
In the middle of nowhere, for that matter. 

I own some land in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, so I've been building a small office as a stepping stone to the full house. Since I need to visit every once in a while to make sure everything is progressing.

Top speed was 132 Mbps, averaging around 50-60 Mbps on clear days. Even through a heavy storm, the internet kept running fine. Needless to say, I've been super impressed.

This is just a simple setup that is not fully permanent, and itâ€™ll be a bit longer before I install it permanently elsewhere. In the meantime, I tied it down with some wire so it doesnâ€™t get tilted during heavy winds. Since itâ€™s a bit hard to source items in this location, you need to think outside the box.

I traveled from Mexico City to a smaller city about 1.5 hours south, then continued another 2.5 hours south to finally install it.
