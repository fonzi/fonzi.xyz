# Facebook down! A warning.
So as you've heard Facebook was down. Not just Facebook, but all of Facebook. Instagram, Whatsapp, Facebook, and some other smaller services. I got to see firsthand how hard this actually was. In the United States, we are pretty lucky that almost every person has a cell phone with data. However, in other countries like Mexico, they use Facebook messenger, and WhatsApp as a means of primary communication. Facebook is free of data usage and so it's WhatsApp down in Mexico with almost every plan that you can buy. For this reason, a lot of people use these services instead of using other non-facebook services. The real issue here is not that Facebook is giving their product for free, but rather, that people are willing to give all that personal information for just a simple messaging app. Data is a Billion dollar industry. Everyone wants data. And people get hardly any compensation for it because they are not aware of how much data is worth. Protect your data. Don't give it away for free, at least make a little profit.
