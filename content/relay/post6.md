After years of performing lead/architect-level QA work without concern for titles, but rather for the sake of learning, I started Bison Software. The surprise wasn't the technical work; it was the taxes. There were forms to fill out with a due date of 30 days before penalties and fees ensued. The true bugs were in the paperwork.

All good software has some bs. I guess all good systems have some bs as well...
